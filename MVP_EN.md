### "The iPhone Moment in Hardware Development: AI-Powered Circuit Generation Breaks Through the 'Da Vinci Code' of Hardware Development"

Subtitle: Tsinghua MVP Team Empowers Large Language Models with "God Mode" in Hardware Development Using PCBTool.ai

The circuit design field has long been constrained by high professional barriers, long development cycles, and high trial-and-error costs, which severely limit innovation speed. According to McKinsey data, global electronic product R&D investment exceeds $500 billion annually, with approximately 40% of costs and time consumed in circuit design. This demand is particularly urgent in emerging fields such as intelligent manufacturing, new energy, and medical electronics. To break through this bottleneck, we have developed an intelligent circuit engineering generation system based on large language models. This system integrates cutting-edge technologies including deep learning, knowledge graphs, and automated design to achieve end-to-end intelligence from requirement understanding to engineering delivery.

### Circuit Engineering Generation System

- **Knowledge-Enhanced Reasoning**: Built a knowledge base containing hundreds of thousands of circuit design cases, combined with RAG technology for precise design decisions
- **Parallel Solution Generation**: Based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS-LLM), generates multiple feasible solutions simultaneously for multi-dimensional comparison
- **Full-Cycle Automation**: Covers all aspects from schematic design to component selection, code generation, and documentation
- **Explainable Design**: Provides detailed design reasoning process and supports interactive solution optimization

### Using NVIDIA NIM Large Language Model, We Achieved

1. Accurate domain knowledge understanding and reasoning capabilities
2. Efficient multi-solution generation and comparative analysis
3. Expert-level design review quality
4. Significant cost and time savings
